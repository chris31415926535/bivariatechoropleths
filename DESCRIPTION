Title: Interactive Bivariate Mapping Made Easy
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Christopher Belanger
Maintainer: Christopher Belanger <christopher.a.belanger@gmail.com>
Description: A bivariate choropleth, or bivariate map, shows how two variables 
   vary across geographical regions. For example, it might show how median 
   income and life expectancy vary across Canadian provinces. With two variables
   we need a two-dimensional colour palette, which comes with considerations
   about accessibility and colour-blindness. This package offers tools for
   creating static and interactive bivariate maps, and for creating and working
   with bivariate colour palettes.
